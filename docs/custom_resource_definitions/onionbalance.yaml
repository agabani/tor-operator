              An `OnionBalance` is an abstraction of a Tor Onion Balance.

              Tor Onion Balance is the best way to load balance Tor Onion Services. The load of introduction and rendezvous requests gets distributed across multiple hosts while also increasing resiliency by eliminating single points of failure.
